# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview and Purpose
-	Completing a review of Kickstarter data containing different campaigns to form the basis of a recommendation to our client Louise.
-	Louise is looking for a summary of this analyzed data that will inform and support her decision to launch her own venture. Key datasets reviewed will be launch dates, and funding goals.

## Analysis

### Analysis 1: Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
_Graphed Data: https://github.com/antbro123/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png_

_**Observations:**_
-	The three months with the greatest number of theater outcomes are May (166), June (153), and July (138)
-	These three months reflect the top 3 successful monthly outcome rates: May (67%), June (65%), and July (63.04%)
-	Although May, June and July represent the top 3 in the categories indicated, April’s totals present an opportunity as well. April outcome total (113), April outcome success rate (62.8%)
-	Continuing with the above, February mirrors all of April’s totals, with the in-between month of March only being slightly behind. March outcome total (92), March outcome success rate (61%)
-	December reflects the lowest theater outcomes (75), and is the only month where the failed/cancelled outcome rate (51%) exceeds the success rate (49%)

_**Conclusion/Recommendation:**_
-	Two suggestions are being presented to Louise based on the findings: 
- **Option 1:** A 4 month campaign of April to July _(primary recommendation)_
- **Option 2:** A 6 month campaign of February to July _(secondary recommendation)_


### Analysis 2: Outcomes Based on Goals
_Graphed Data: https://github.com/antbro123/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png_

_**Observations:**_
-	There are no canceled Theater Plays at any goal level
-	Less than $5000:__________Successful:529   Failed:191
-	Greater than $5000:_______Successful:165   Failed:162
-	All Combined:_____________Successful: 694  Failed:353		
-	The 529 successes having goals less than $5000 represent 76% of the total successful (694)
-	Failed reflects 54% less than $5000 and 46% greater than $5000 

_**Conclusion/Recommendation:**_
-	It is suggested that Louise establishes fundraising goals less than $5000 which has resulted in greater success

### Limitations/Additional Questions
-	Although we have reviewed a grouping by month, the bulk of data reviewed is contained in 2014, 2015, and 2016 within the years of 2010 to 2017. Is that a wide enough array of data to truly inform a decision today? Unsure.
-	Are there other factors that contribute to the success/failure/cancelation of campaigns? One example not analyzed here is the duration of each campaign. 
-	Is there a correlation between staff picks/backing and the average donation amount?
